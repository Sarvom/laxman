Ever since I watched the Consensus2022 presentation by Rob Viglione about zkSNARKs, 
made me curious how Horizen plans its scalability. This blog is a short deep dive into 
Horizen Blockchain and relevent comparisions.

-- lib.blog-post: Horizen ($ZEN)

Horizen is a general-purpose blockchain system with novel Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
(CCTP) that enables an unbound and fully decentralized sidechain ecosystem

A peer-to-peer, permissionless and incentivised network that enables you to build a 
custom blockchain and applicaiton on the layer using Sidechain-SDK, a development kit 
devised to deploy a blockchain with fully customisable features and Dapps using 
Horizenâ€™s scalability and extenisbility. Multiple convocations of sidechains 
(parallel chains) transmit messages to each other and the mainchain via CCTP.

As of writing, Horizen has 45k active nodes running with an stake requirement of 42 $ZEN
at an average price of $15.08 and estimated earning per node of about $4.17 ($50.75 a 
year)

Horizen has an intense focus on enabling zero-knowledge protocol to let application 
verify information without revealing the information itself. This helps companies 
building supply chains on Horizen share product data with customers without revealing 
sensitive information, like identities of people involved in supply chain or locations 
of factories
