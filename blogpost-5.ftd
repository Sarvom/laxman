-- lib.blog: Eth2, The Merge and L1s

-- lib.blog-post: Introduction

Prices of L1s are known to be volatile and its hard to spin a number on its valuation. 
Instead, using metrics as Total Value Locked, number of transactions and users count we 
will see the comparision of Eth2 with other L1s. With Ethereum‚Äôs upcoming transition 
from Proof of Work (POW) to Proof of Stake (POS), we can now use staking yields as a 
basis of comparison across all Layer-1 tokens.

-- lib.blog-post: The Merge üêº

The Beacon Chain, a Ethereum POS network has been running parallel with Ethereum since 
December 2020. The transition from POW consensus to POS has been awaited and anticipated 
by many. On the merge, the Ethereum‚Äôs POW consensus layer will be removed and all future 
blocks on Ethereum are expected and will be achieved by the then merged Beacon Chain‚Äôs 
POS Consensus layer.

The Ethereum team has been workign on making this happen along with series of other 
tests and conducts that regulate the process and safety after the merge including the 
Kiln public testnet Merge in March and the most recent 4th shadow fork

Merge is expected to happen in Q3/Q4 2022.

-- lib.blog-post:

The important takeaway from the Merge is that it does not help scale Ethereum! If so 
what is the point then?

- Proof-of-Work concensus has a laborious requirement of energy. Miners running nodes in 
a POW system use powerful GPUs that requires vast amount of electricity to run the 
calculations and cryptographic puzzles - hashing algorithms that so as to keep the 
network and funds secure. Comparatively, any recent consumer hardware is capable of 
being ETH2 validator. And pushing a node to the network to participare in network‚Äôs 
consensus algorithm with a minimum stake requirements of 32 ETH and if incase any sort 
of malicious activities by the validatos leads to slashing of their staked funds.

In addition, since POW requires expensive hardware and electricity costs, ETH token 
inflation has been around 4.3% per year to compensate the miners for their work. With 
POS being more energy-efficient, the cost to secure the Ethereum network (token 
inflation) is much less. Ethereum‚Äôs POS issuance model is based on how much ETH is being 
staked. Currently, there are about 12.5M ETH staked on the Beacon Chain ‚Äì at that level, 
annual issuance would be about 0.5%.

Although, this new merge is giving out opportunities to develop many Proof-of-Stake 
distruibuted validator layer protocols and middleware clients. that enables you to run 
validators across other independent nodes safely. Like, Charon from Obol Labs

-- lib.blog-quote:

Charon integrates into the Ethereum consensus stack as a middleware between the 
validator client and the beacon node via the official Eth Beacon Node REST API. Charon 
supports any upstream beacon node that serves the Beacon API. Charon supports any 
downstream standalone validator client that consumes the Beacon API.

-- lib.blog-post:

One of the advantage of Chaon is you that you can participate in the network‚Äôs consensus 
by staking only half the required stake amounts and eark equivalent rewards on your 
validator nodes.

An yield return depends on the ETH staked which drives the staking returns

-- lib.blog-post:

The above table estimations are upped with few assumptions excluding MEV, with the 
current ETH staked on Beacon chain(~10% supply, 12.5M ETH).

-- lib.blog-post: - ETH Staking Yields vs Competing L1s

Looking at nominal yields, ETH is about middle of the pack compared to its major 
competitors, with yields ranging from 6.64% to 17.53% in nominal terms. However, with 
the exception of BNB, all of the other tokens in the competitive set are inflationary. 
Factoring in token issuance rates, ETH has the highest staking returns on a real yield 
basis.

-- lib.blog-post:

One point to note is that currently only 10.3% of ETH is staked on the Beacon Chain, 
which is the lowest in the competitive set and likely due to concerns about locking up 
ETH for a long time (withdrawals are not possible currently). Staking should increase 
post-Merge as the execution risk of the Merge is removed, ETH moves closer to enabling 
staking withdrawal, and more people grow comfortable with staking ETH. Staking 
participation amongst competing L1s ranges from 35% to 76% with an average of 55%. If 
ETH staking participation increases to the average of 55%, real staking yields for ETH 
would likely decrease to approximately 4.21%. At 55% of supply staked, ETH‚Äôs real yield 
would project to be higher than SOL, AVAX and MATIC, but lower than BNB, DOT, NEAR and 
FTM

After factoring in projected increases to circulating supply over the next year for the 
competitive set, ETH‚Äôs real staking yield net of dilution is the highest if we assume 
staking participation remains the same. If ETH‚Äôs staking participation reaches 55%, then 
ETH would rank higher than SOL, AVAX, NEAR and MATIC but lower than BNB, DOT and FTM.
